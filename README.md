# Health-Data-Analysis-Hypothesis-Testing
This repository contains files related to a data analysis project focusing on cardiovascular health.

**Files Overview**

Here's a brief explanation of each file in this repository:

**Dashboard.png:**
This image file is an export of a dashboard. It visualizes the insights and findings derived from the data analysis, created using a tool like Power BI or Tableau.

**README.md:**
This file, which you are currently reading, serves as the main documentation for this repository. It provides an overview of the project, explains the purpose of each file, and offers guidance on how to navigate and understand the contents.

**cardio_alco.csv:**
This is a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file, a common format for tabular data. It contains data related to cardiovascular health and alcohol consumption, used for analysis.

**cardio_base.csv:**
Similar to cardio_alco.csv, this is another CSV file containing base data related to cardiovascular health. It includes general health metrics, demographic information, and other foundational data points for the analysis.

**eda_cardio.ipynb:**
This file is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Jupyter Notebooks are interactive computing environments used for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. eda_cardio.ipynb contains the code (Python, R, etc.), visualizations, and narrative text for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the cardiovascular datasets. This is where the initial data cleaning, transformation, and insight generation took place.

**eda_cardio.pbiX:**
This file is a  Microsoft Power BI Desktop file (.pbiX). It contains a Power BI report, including data models, queries, and visualizations. This file is used to create the interactive dashboard or report based on the cardio_alco.csv and cardio_base.csv datasets, and the insights from eda_cardio.ipynb.
